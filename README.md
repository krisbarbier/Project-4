# Chicago Crime Data
 
## A Look at Crimes in Chicago in 2021-2022

By: Kris Barbier

### Business Problem:

- How have crime rates changed over time in Chicago?
- What types of crime are most common?
- When are crimes most likely to occur, and where within the city?

### Data:

Data Source: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2

## Methods:

- The data was processed into different csv files pertaining to crimes per 1 year at a time (2001 to the present).
- All csv files were then combined and processed to do time series analysis to answer the following questions:
  - Which district has the most crimes? Which district has the least crimes?
  - Is the total number of crimes increasing or decreasing across the years?
  - Are there any individual crimes that are doing the opposite (e.g decreasing when overall crime is increasing or vice-versa)?
  - What months have the most crime? What months have the least?
  - Are there any individual crimes that do not follow this pattern? If so, which crimes?
- The data was then analyzed using Tableau to create a story looking at when and where crimes most occur in the years 2021-2022.

## Final Considerations:

- Crime in Chicago has an overall upward trend in 2021-2022, and is projected to increase going into 2023. The city may want to allocate more funds to the police department in order to mitigate the increasing crime rates.
- Crimes are most frequent overall on Fridays and in District 6. Crimes are least frequent overall on Thursdays and in District 20.
